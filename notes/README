The Slidy HTML files are produced by pandoc. As an example :-

pandoc 05-map.md -o 05-map.html -f markdown+pipe_tables \
-t slidy --standalone --slide-level=3

pandoc can be found at <http://pandoc.org> and can be installed with homebrew.

It is being served out on my Mac via 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer'
