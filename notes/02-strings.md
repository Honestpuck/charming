#### Strings

Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. 
They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result. 
`\` can be used to escape quotes:

``` python
>>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes
'spam eggs'
>>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote...
"doesn't"
>>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead
"doesn't"
>>> '"Yes," he said.'
'"Yes," he said.'
>>> "\"Yes,\" he said."
'"Yes," he said.'
>>> '"Isn\'t," she said.'
'"Isn\'t," she said.'
```

###
#### Literals

String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes: """...""" or '''...'''. End of lines are automatically included in the string, but itâ€™s possible to prevent this by adding a \ at the end of the line. The following example:

``` python
print """\
Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
     -h                        Display this usage message
     -H hostname               Hostname to connect to
"""
```	 
produces the following output (note that the initial newline is not included):
```
Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
     -h                        Display this usage message
     -H hostname               Hostname to connect to
```

###
#### Concatenation
Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with *:

``` python
>>>
>>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'
>>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium'
'unununium'
```

Two or more string literals (i.e. the ones enclosed between quotes) next to each other are automatically concatenated.

``` python
>>>
>>> 'Py' 'thon'
'Python'
```

###

This only works with two literals though, not with variables or expressions:

``` python
>>>
>>> prefix = 'Py'
>>> prefix 'thon'  # can't concatenate a variable and a string literal
  ...
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> ('un' * 3) 'ium'
  ...
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

If you want to concatenate variables or a variable and a literal, use +:

``` python
>>>
>>> prefix + 'thon'
'Python'
```

This feature is particularly useful when you want to break long strings:

``` python
>>>
>>> text = ('Put several strings within parentheses '
            'to have them joined together.')
>>> text
'Put several strings within parentheses to have them joined together.'
```

###
#### String indexing
Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character having index 0. There is no separate character type; a character is simply a string of size one:

``` python
>>>
>>> word = 'Python'
>>> word[0]  # character in position 0
'P'
>>> word[5]  # character in position 5
'n'
```

Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right:
``` python
>>>
>>> word[-1]  # last character
'n'
>>> word[-2]  # second-last character
'o'
>>> word[-6]
'P'
```
Note that since -0 is the same as 0, negative indices start from -1.

###

In addition to indexing, slicing is also supported. While indexing is used to obtain individual characters, slicing allows you to obtain a substring:

``` python
>>>
>>> word[0:2]  # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)
'Py'
>>> word[2:5]  # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded)
'tho'
```

Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded. This makes sure that s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s:

``` python
>>>
>>> word[:2] + word[2:]
'Python'
>>> word[:4] + word[4:]
'Python'
```

###
Slice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults to zero, an omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced.

``` python
>>>
>>> word[:2]  # character from the beginning to position 2 (excluded)
'Py'
>>> word[4:]  # characters from position 4 (included) to the end
'on'
>>> word[-2:] # characters from the second-last (included) to the end
'on'
```
###
One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing between characters, with the left edge of the first character numbered 0. Then the right edge of the last character of a string of n characters has index n, for example:

``` python
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+
 | P | y | t | h | o | n |
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
-6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
```

The first row of numbers gives the position of the indices 0...6 in the string; the second row gives the corresponding negative indices. The slice from i to j consists of all characters between the edges labeled i and j, respectively.
###
For non-negative indices, the length of a slice is the difference of the indices, if both are within bounds. For example, the length of word[1:3] is 2.

Attempting to use a index that is too large will result in an error:

``` python
>>>
>>> word[42]  # the word only has 6 characters
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: string index out of range
```
###
However, out of range slice indexes are handled gracefully when used for slicing:

``` python
>>>
>>> word[4:42]
'on'
>>> word[42:]
''
```
The built-in function len() returns the length of a string:

``` python
>>>
>>> s = 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'
>>> len(s)
34
```
